Though FDA is approving more than one medical imaging algorithm per month, 
datasets are biased due to geography, scenarios, etc. 
BlackBox issue still exist, AI fails sometimes, and the medical arena is conservative, 
Increasing the motivation for developing explainable AI 
on top of decision making for the radiologist/pathologist.
I wonder what is the feedback from the radiologists
