I’m honored to receive an appreciation award for being a mentor and active participant in the Entrepreneurs Program at the Adelson School of Entrepreneurship.
It’s been an exciting experience working with bright and motivated students, focusing on innovation, in AI, helping them bring their ideas to POC, and characterizing MVP. 
A big thank you to the Adelson School for giving me the chance to be part of this amazing program.
