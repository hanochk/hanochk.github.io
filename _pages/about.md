<h3>Bio</h3>

<p>27 years of research engineering in Israeli hi-tech<br>
I'm an AI expert (CV| ML| AI | LLM |DSP) with 25 yrs of experience as Sr. Applied research engineer and TL.
I played pivotal roles in the early stages of two automotive startups, one acquired by Qualcomm and the other successfully went public through an IPO.
My distinct value lies in a the last 11 years focusing on AI, particularly in CV, ML, and LLM. Researched and developed AI models which has been implemented in production, delivering tangible impacts for numerous clients.
